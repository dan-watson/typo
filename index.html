      <h1>Typo Demo</h1>

      <p>OK <em>this</em> this the typo demo. It's <em>pretty</em> opinionated and very <strong>small</strong> lets take a closer look. Notice the dropcaps, hanging punctionation inside <em>blockquotes</em> and also the hanging bullet points. Looks like something out of an old book don't you think!? Legebility is the key here.</p>

      <h2>Isaiah 53 - King James Bible</h2>

      <p>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the <span class="lord">LORD</span> revealed?  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. </p>

      <p>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. </p>

      <p>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. </p>

      <h3>A Suffering Messiah</h3>
      <p>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. </p>

      <p>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the <span class="lord">LORD</span> hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. </p>

      <p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p>

      <p>He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</p>

      <p>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p>

      <p>Yet it pleased the <span class="lord">LORD</span> to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the <span class="lord">LORD</span> shall prosper in his hand.</p>

      <h3>A Sacrifice That Justifies Many</h3>
      <p>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

      <p>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
