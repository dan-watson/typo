      <h1>Typo Demo</h1>

      <p>OK <em>this</em> this the typo demo. It's <em>pretty</em> opinionated and very <strong>small</strong> lets take a closer look. Notice the dropcaps, hanging punctionation inside <em>blockquotes</em> and also the hanging bullet points. Looks like something out of an old book don't you think!? Legebility is the key here.</p>

        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Isaiah 53 - King James Bible</h2>

      <p>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the <span class="lord">LORD</span> revealed?  For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. </p>

      <p>He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. </p>

      <p>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. </p>

      <h3>A Suffering Messiah</h3>
      <p>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. </p>

      <p>All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the <span class="lord">LORD</span> hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. </p>

      <p>He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</p>

      <p>He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</p>

      <p>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</p>

      <p>Yet it pleased the <span class="lord">LORD</span> to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the <span class="lord">LORD</span> shall prosper in his hand.</p>

      <h3>A Sacrifice That Justifies Many</h3>
      <p>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

      <p>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>

      <h2>Crazy Ones</h2>
      <p>Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.</p>
      <p>You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.</p>
      <p>Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>
